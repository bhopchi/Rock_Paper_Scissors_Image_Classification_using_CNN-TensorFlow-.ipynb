# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Image_Classification_using_CNN-TensorFlow-.ipynb
This project uses a CNN in TensorFlow to classify hand gestures for "Rock," "Paper," and "Scissors." Preprocessed images are augmented for robustness, then passed through convolutional and pooling layers to extract features, followed by dense layers. High accuracy proves the modelâ€™s effectiveness in gesture recognition.
